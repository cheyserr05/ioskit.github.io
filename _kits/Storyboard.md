In Xcode 4.2, the Interface Builder user interface for iOS app UI design is based on using storyboards, that is, images of view controllers populated with user interface objects and connected together with segues. Storyboards enable you to use Interface Builder to specify all the screens in your application, including the transitions between them and the controls used to trigger the transitions. With storyboards, you can lay out every possible path through your application graphically, greatly reducing the amount of code you need to write for a complex multiscreen application.
