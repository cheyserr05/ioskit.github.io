For Reminders.

Contains classes for displaying the standard system calendar interfaces.

The Event Kit framework grants access to users’ Calendar.app and Reminders.app information. Although two different apps display users’ calendar and reminder data, the same framework manipulates the data. Similarly, the database that stores this data, called the Calendar database, holds both calendar and reminder information.
