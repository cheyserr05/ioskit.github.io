The *AVKit framework* (`AVKit.framework`) previously introduced on OS X is available on iOS. It leverages existing objects in AV Foundation to manage the presentation of video on a device. It is intended as a replacement for the [Media Player framework](/MediaPlayer) when you need to display video content.
